## BSA Team Help

## Data Journalism Team
Here are some helpful tips for getting started on some data journalism articles:

1. What data do I have?

- Basketball-reference.com, baseball-reference.com, etc.
- http://harvardsportsanalysis.org/links-2/
- https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/9818/open-sports-data
- https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/blog/2014/03/where-find-sports-data
- Personally contact companies for access
- Check out BSA's Resource Folder of course!

2. Idea time!
- Topical idea?
- Reflection on past event?
- A product a coach could use for the athletes?
- Trying to predict something before it happens?
- Keep an idea book with you, and try to come up with 2 ideas a day!

3. Partners
- Is this task too big for you to handle? Need a skilled programmer? A writer? Ask around in the meetings or on the data journalism channel
- Create a group via text, slack, messenger and discuss your project idea and the steps needed to complete in time.
- Assign tasks for each person to complete, and set up weekly meetings to discuss progress and review peerâ€™s work

4. Schedule your work appropriately!
- Set aside 2-4 hours a week to work and explore through a project!
- Sticking to the schedule will pay off in the long run

5. Submit
Things to keep in mind:
- Email or share a google/word doc to bruinsportsanalyticsclub@gmail.com
- Make sure that the cover photo is large!
- For youtube videos, make sure to specify the embed link!
- Work together with blog chair to complete a finished project
- Share and publish on Facebook/Twitter. If you have a lot of articles, consider creating your own website for job purposes!

Awesome articles to use as benchmark:
- http://www.bruinsportsanalytics.com/wawrinka (In-depth pieces)
- http://www.bruinsportsanalytics.com/wsoccer18 (traditional DJ articles)

Blurb: *First/Third Person*
Unless you have good reason, we shall try to write our articles in the third person.

*Sources*
- State which data source you used at the end of the article. Ex: "Source: basketball-reference.com"
- For created visuals or cover photos, also state the source. Ex: "Allen Berezovsky/Getty Images". Make sure your cover photo is large and of high-quality.

**Try NOT to report just simple statistics!**

We can do better than pointing out a pitcher has a low ERA at the moment, see 538 for further exploration on topics. We are an analytics club for a reason.

**For larger articles**

Title it: "An In-Depth Analysis of _____"

**Links**

If you have a side story which you mention which could be worth the reader's time, please embed the link!

**Great 538 Articles**

## Research Team

**Look at some SLOAN Papers**

**Gathering Your Idea**
- Contact your teammate(s) and set up an hour to discuss over messenger or in-person different ideas to pursue.
- Ask yourself who your audience is for this research:
  - Front Office?
  - Fans? (Most likely will not be submitted for a journal, unless novel idea)
  - Players?
  - Coach/Team Manager?
- Choose ideas that are obtainable. Here is a link to papers/posters submitted to SLOAN. These are more wide-ranging than you are likely to work towards (which is ok)
- Check out our resource folder or website for inspiration

**Prepping For What's Ahead**
- Set up a weekly time to meet up in-person/skype/messenger to discuss next steps or general project points throughout the quarter.
- First first few weeks:
  - Gather your idea
  - Find data sources to help you solve your problem. (Let us know if you want us to buy data for you, it's what our funds are for)
  - Understand what technologies you plan on using (R, Python, Excel, SQL)
  - Sketch general timeline (including interim report dates) for the next 2 quarters
  - Split up roles each team member will play
